# Taonado Deposit Secrets and Privacy Notes

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Two Completely Different Systems

Taonado operates **two separate systems** with completely different security models. **Understanding this difference is crucial for fund safety.**

**Quick Answer**:
- üè¶ **WTAO Mining** (what our utilities use) = ‚ùå **NO SECRETS NEEDED**
- üïµÔ∏è **Privacy Mixer** = ‚úÖ **REQUIRES SECRET NOTES**

## WTAO Mining vs Privacy Mixer Systems

**üìñ For Complete Details**: See [`TAONADO_SYSTEMS_EXPLAINED.md`](./TAONADO_SYSTEMS_EXPLAINED.md)

**Amounts**: Any amount works (0.25 TAO, 1.5 TAO, etc.)

**Commands Used:**
- `pnpm miner` (standard mining)
- `npx ts-node utils/test-miner.ts` (custom amounts)
- All utilities in this repository

### üïµÔ∏è Privacy Mixer System (Requires Secrets)
**Purpose**: Anonymous mixing for complete privacy
**Process**: WTAO ‚Üí Anonymous pools ‚Üí zk-SNARK proofs
**Secrets**: ‚úÖ **GENERATES SECRET NOTES (CRITICAL!)**
**Withdrawal**: Only possible with the secret note
**Privacy**: ‚úÖ Completely anonymous and untraceable
**Safety**: Secret note is the ONLY way to recover funds

**Commands Used:**
- `pnpm cli` ‚Üí Privacy Operations ‚Üí Privacy Deposit
- Creates anonymous pools with zk-SNARK proofs

## Secret Notes Explained

### What Are Secret Notes?
When you make a **privacy deposit** (not mining), Taonado generates a secret note that looks like:
```
taonado-eth-0.1-5-0x1234...abcd-0x5678...efgh
```

This note contains:
- **Network**: taonado-eth
- **Amount**: 0.1 TAO
- **Tree depth**: 5
- **Nullifier**: Secret for spending
- **Commitment**: Proof of deposit

### Critical Security Rules

‚ö†Ô∏è **THE SECRET NOTE IS EVERYTHING**
- Without the secret note, **your funds are permanently lost**
- Taonado cannot recover lost notes
- No customer support can help you
- No blockchain recovery is possible

‚úÖ **How to Store Secret Notes Safely**
1. **Password Manager** (1Password, Bitwarden, etc.)
2. **Encrypted File** on multiple devices
3. **Physical Paper** in a safe location
4. **Never** store in plain text files
5. **Never** share or post online

## When Secrets Are Created

### ‚ùå Mining Operations (No Secrets)
- `pnpm miner`
- `pnpm deposit`
- `npx ts-node utils/test-miner.ts`
- Any WTAO contract deposits

### ‚úÖ Privacy Operations (Creates Secrets)
- `pnpm cli` ‚Üí Privacy Operations ‚Üí Privacy Deposit
- Direct calls to Taonado mixer contracts
- Anonymous pool deposits

## Our Test Setup Analysis

**What we did**: Mining deposits for emissions
**Secret status**: ‚ùå No secrets were created
**Your funds**: Safe in WTAO contract
**Withdrawal**: Use `pnpm withdraw` anytime

**Proof**: Check your transaction on blockchain explorer - it's a standard WTAO deposit, not a privacy commitment.

## Privacy Deposit Example (If You Use Later)

If you decide to use privacy deposits later:

1. **Run**: `pnpm cli`
2. **Choose**: "üïµÔ∏è Privacy Operations" ‚Üí "üîí Privacy Deposit"
3. **Select pool**: 0.1, 1, 10, 100, or 1000 TAO
4. **CRITICAL**: Save the secret note immediately
5. **Test**: Verify you can read the note before leaving

**Example session:**
```
‚úÖ Privacy deposit completed successfully!

üîë YOUR SECRET NOTE (SAVE THIS SECURELY):
==========================================
taonado-eth-1-20-0x1a2b3c...def-0x4e5f6g...hij
==========================================

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Without this note, you cannot withdraw your funds!
```

## Summary

**‚úÖ What You Actually Did**: WTAO Mining (no secrets involved)
**‚úÖ Your Funds Status**: Safe in WTAO contract, withdrawable anytime with private key
**‚úÖ Secret Notes**: Not applicable to your setup - only needed for privacy mixer
**‚úÖ Why Our Utilities Work**: They focus on WTAO mining system (the safer option)

**Key Understanding**:
- üè¶ **WTAO Mining** = Bank account (safe, recoverable, no secrets)
- üïµÔ∏è **Privacy Mixer** = Cash (anonymous, but lose the note = lose everything)

**Next Steps**:
- Monitor your mining performance with `npx ts-node utils/mining-status.ts`
- Consider privacy mixer later if you need anonymity (understand the risks first)
- Your current setup is the recommended starting point for new users

**Remember**: The Taonado website (taonado.cash) emphasizes privacy mixer features, but WTAO mining is equally valid and often more practical for most users!
