# Taonado Deposit Secrets and Privacy Notes

## Overview

Taonado has two different types of deposits, each with different security and privacy characteristics. It's crucial to understand the difference.

## Mining Deposits vs Privacy Deposits

### Mining Deposits (What We Set Up)
**Purpose**: Earn emissions on Subnet 113 by providing liquidity
**Process**: Deposit TAO ‚Üí WTAO contract
**Secrets**: ‚ùå **NO SECRETS CREATED**
**Withdrawal**: Standard blockchain transactions anytime
**Privacy**: ‚ùå Transactions are public and traceable
**Safety**: Your TAO is in the WTAO contract, withdrawable with your private key

**Commands Used:**
- `pnpm miner` (standard mining)
- `npx ts-node utils/test-miner.ts` (custom amounts)
- Scripts deposit into WTAO contract for emissions

### Privacy Deposits (Different System)
**Purpose**: Anonymous mixing for complete privacy
**Process**: WTAO ‚Üí Anonymous pools (0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000 TAO)
**Secrets**: ‚úÖ **GENERATES SECRET NOTES**

**Privacy**: ‚úÖ Completely anonymous and untraceable
**Safety**: Secret note is the ONLY way to recover funds

**Commands Used:**

## Secret Notes Explained

### What Are Secret Notes?
When you make a **privacy deposit** (not mining), Taonado generates a secret note that looks like:
```
taonado-eth-0.1-5-0x1234...abcd-0x5678...efgh
```

This note contains:
- **Network**: taonado-eth
- **Amount**: 0.1 TAO
- **Tree depth**: 5
- **Nullifier**: Secret for spending
- **Commitment**: Proof of deposit

### Critical Security Rules

‚ö†Ô∏è **THE SECRET NOTE IS EVERYTHING**
- Without the secret note, **your funds are permanently lost**
- Taonado cannot recover lost notes
- No customer support can help you
- No blockchain recovery is possible

‚úÖ **How to Store Secret Notes Safely**
1. **Password Manager** (1Password, Bitwarden, etc.)
2. **Encrypted File** on multiple devices
3. **Physical Paper** in a safe location
4. **Never** store in plain text files
5. **Never** share or post online
