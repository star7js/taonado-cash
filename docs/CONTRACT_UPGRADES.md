# Contract Upgrade Procedures

This document provides comprehensive guidance for upgrading Taonado smart contracts, including planning, testing, execution, and rollback procedures.

## Upgrade Architecture Overview

Taonado uses a mixed architecture for contract upgradeability:

| Contract | Upgrade Pattern | Reason |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| **EvmValidator** | UUPS Proxy | Configuration updates, bug fixes |
| **WTAO** | Immutable | Critical fund custody, security |
| **DepositTracker** | Immutable | Association integrity |
| **WeightsV2** | Replaceable | Algorithm improvements |
| **Verifier** | Immutable | Cryptographic integrity |

### UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard)

The EvmValidator contract uses OpenZeppelin's UUPS pattern:

```solidity
contract EvmValidator is OwnableUpgradeable, UUPSUpgradeable {
    function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation)
        internal override onlyOwner {}
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Owner-controlled upgrades
- Gas efficient
- No external proxy admin needed
- Upgrade authorization built into implementation

## Upgrade Planning

### When to Upgrade

#### EvmValidator Upgrade Scenarios
1. **Bug Fixes**: Critical security issues
2. **Feature Additions**: New functionality (bounty adjustments, etc.)
3. **Gas Optimizations**: Performance improvements
4. **Parameter Updates**: Configuration changes

#### Non-Upgradeable Contract Replacement
1. **Algorithm Changes**: New weight calculation logic
2. **Major Refactors**: Significant architectural changes
3. **Deprecation**: Replacing old contracts with new versions

### Pre-Upgrade Assessment

#### Impact Analysis
```bash
# Assess upgrade impact
npx ts-node tools/upgrade-impact-analysis.ts \
  --contract EvmValidator \
  --new-implementation $NEW_IMPL_ADDRESS

# Check:
# - Storage layout compatibility
# - Function signature changes
# - State variable modifications
# - External dependency changes
```

#### Risk Assessment Matrix
| Risk Level | Criteria | Mitigation |
|------------|----------|------------|
| **Low** | Bug fixes, gas optimizations | Standard testing |
| **Medium** | New features, parameter changes | Extended testing, staged rollout |
| **High** | Storage changes, major refactors | Comprehensive testing, emergency procedures |

## Upgrade Testing

### Development Testing

#### Local Upgrade Testing
```bash
# 1. Deploy original contract to local network
pnpm deploy-local

# 2. Deploy new implementation
npx ts-node scripts/deploy-upgrade-implementation.ts --network local

# 3. Test upgrade process
npx ts-node scripts/test-upgrade.ts --network local --dry-run

# 4. Verify upgrade functionality
npx ts-node scripts/verify-upgrade.ts --network local
```

#### Upgrade Test Script Example
```typescript
// scripts/test-upgrade.ts
import { ethers, upgrades } from "hardhat";

async function testUpgrade() {
  // Get current proxy address
  const proxyAddress = "0x..."; // Current EvmValidator proxy

  // Deploy new implementation
  const NewImplementation = await ethers.getContractFactory("MockUpgradedEvmValidator");

  // Test upgrade (dry run)
  console.log("Testing upgrade compatibility...");
  await upgrades.validateUpgrade(proxyAddress, NewImplementation);

  // Execute upgrade
  console.log("Executing upgrade...");
  const upgraded = await upgrades.upgradeProxy(proxyAddress, NewImplementation);
  await upgraded.waitForDeployment();

  // Verify new functionality
  if (upgraded.newFunction) {
    const result = await upgraded.newFunction();
    console.log("New function result:", result);
  }

  console.log("‚úÖ Upgrade test completed successfully");
}
```

### Testnet Testing

#### Comprehensive Testnet Validation
```bash
# 1. Deploy to testnet
pnpm deploy-testnet

# 2. Run full test suite
pnpm test --network subevm

# 3. Execute upgrade on testnet
npx ts-node scripts/execute-upgrade.ts --network subevm

# 4. Validate all functionality
npx ts-node scripts/validate-upgrade.ts --network subevm

# 5. Performance testing
npx ts-node scripts/upgrade-performance-test.ts --network subevm
```

#### State Migration Testing
```bash
# Test with realistic state
npx ts-node scripts/setup-realistic-test-state.ts --network subevm

# Include:
# - Multiple miners with deposits
# - Various weight settings
# - Bounty configurations
# - Historical transaction data
```

## Upgrade Execution

### Upgrade Scripts

#### EvmValidator Upgrade Script
```typescript
// scripts/upgrade-evm-validator.ts
import { ethers, upgrades } from "hardhat";
import { config } from "../config";

async function upgradeEvmValidator() {
  console.log("üîÑ Starting EvmValidator upgrade...");

  // Get current proxy address (from deployment records)
  const proxyAddress = getDeployedAddress("EvmValidator", config.env);

  // Get owner wallet
  const owner = new ethers.Wallet(config.ethPrivateKey, ethers.provider);

  // Deploy new implementation
  console.log("üì¶ Deploying new implementation...");
  const NewEvmValidator = await ethers.getContractFactory("EvmValidatorV2", owner);

  // Validate upgrade compatibility
  console.log("üîç Validating upgrade compatibility...");
  await upgrades.validateUpgrade(proxyAddress, NewEvmValidator);

  // Execute upgrade
  console.log("‚ö° Executing upgrade...");
  const upgraded = await upgrades.upgradeProxy(proxyAddress, NewEvmValidator);
  await upgraded.waitForDeployment();

  // Verify upgrade
  console.log("‚úÖ Verifying upgrade...");
  const implementationAddress = await upgrades.erc1967.getImplementationAddress(proxyAddress);
  console.log("New implementation:", implementationAddress);

  // Test basic functionality
  console.log("üß™ Testing basic functionality...");
  const tx = await upgraded.setVersionKey(1);
  await tx.wait();

  console.log("üéâ Upgrade completed successfully!");

  return {
    proxy: proxyAddress,
    implementation: implementationAddress,
    txHash: tx.hash
  };
}
```

#### Step-by-Step Execution
```bash
# 1. Final preparation
export UPGRADE_ENV=mainnet
export NEW_IMPLEMENTATION_HASH=0xabc...

# 2. Pre-flight checks
npx ts-node scripts/pre-upgrade-checks.ts --env $UPGRADE_ENV

# 3. Execute upgrade
npx ts-node scripts/upgrade-evm-validator.ts \
  --env $UPGRADE_ENV \
  --implementation $NEW_IMPLEMENTATION_HASH \
  --confirm

# 4. Post-upgrade validation
npx ts-node scripts/post-upgrade-validation.ts --env $UPGRADE_ENV

# 5. Monitor system health
npx ts-node scripts/monitor-post-upgrade.ts --duration 1h
```

### Non-Upgradeable Contract Replacement

For contracts that cannot be upgraded (WTAO, DepositTracker, etc.):

#### Replacement Strategy
```bash
# 1. Deploy new contract version
npx ts-node scripts/deploy-weights-v3.ts --network mainnet

# 2. Update EvmValidator to use new contract
npx ts-node scripts/update-weights-contract.ts \
  --new-address $NEW_WEIGHTS_ADDRESS \
  --network mainnet

# 3. Verify migration
npx ts-node scripts/verify-contract-migration.ts --network mainnet

# 4. Update documentation and monitoring
npx ts-node scripts/update-deployment-docs.ts --network mainnet
```

## Post-Upgrade Procedures

#### Rollback Decision Matrix
| Issue Severity | Time to Rollback | Authorization Required |
|----------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Critical | Immediate | Technical lead |
| High | < 1 hour | Technical + business lead |
| Medium | < 4 hours | Full stakeholder review |

### Rollback Execution

#### Emergency Rollback
```bash
# Emergency rollback to previous implementation
npx ts-node scripts/emergency-rollback.ts \
  --contract EvmValidator \
  --previous-implementation $PREVIOUS_IMPL_ADDRESS \
  --confirm-emergency

# This script:
# 1. Validates previous implementation
# 2. Executes immediate rollback
# 3. Verifies functionality
# 4. Notifies stakeholders
```

#### Standard Rollback
```bash
# Planned rollback procedure
npx ts-node scripts/planned-rollback.ts \
  --contract EvmValidator \
  --target-version v1.2.0 \
  --reason "Performance issues" \
  --schedule "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
```

### Post-Rollback Procedures

#### Immediate Actions
```bash
# 1. Verify system functionality
npx ts-node scripts/verify-rollback.ts

# 2. Monitor for stability
npx ts-node scripts/monitor-post-rollback.ts --duration 2h

# 3. Analyze failure cause
npx ts-node scripts/analyze-upgrade-failure.ts

# 4. Update incident documentation
npx ts-node scripts/update-incident-log.ts
```

#### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Technical Analysis**: What went wrong?
2. **Process Review**: How could it be prevented?
3. **Testing Gaps**: What wasn't caught in testing?
4. **Monitoring Improvements**: Better detection needed?
